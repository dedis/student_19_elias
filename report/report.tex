\section{Introduction}

introduction to the problem space: what problem, setting, context

outline the situation: what solution exists, what are its properties

outline the solution approach: gossip, what are its properties

give an overview of the rest of the paper: sections


\section{Motivation}

why is this even relevant: general idea

blockchain

software transparency~\cite{Ford16}

what are the shortcomings

criteria


\section{Background}

background is this and that


\subsection{Gossip protocols}

random peer selection

push and pull

two state and three state

very short lived sets this apart

tradeoffs


\subsection{BLS cosigning}

what is cosigning

aggregation: what is it, why is it useful

BLS

BDN

difficulties


\section{Implementation}

golang

cothority, onet, kyber

the protocol itself in detail: including shutdown

the parameters and what do they do

reason for this architecture


\section{Methodology for evaluation of the protocol through experiments}

simulation framework

vary one or two parameters at a time to isolate the effect


\section{Results}

big section


\section{Evaluation and discussion of the findings}

general things about the protocol

strengths and limitations


\subsection{Limitations}

no adaptive behavior

no guarantees apart from probabilistic

need to be access-restricted


\subsection{Future work}

selecting peers, but watch out

aggregation, but hard

push and pull as an optimization

messages as an optimization


\section{Conclusion}

conclude
